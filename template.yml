Description: >-
  Tools to regularly trigger drift detection on AWS CloudFormation Stacks

Transform:
  - AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31

Parameters:
  Regions:
    Type: String
    Default: all
    Description: >-
      Comma-separated list of regions to scan for CloudFormation stacks, e.g. ap-southeast-2,us-west-2.
      "all" means scan all available regions.
  DriftDetectionMinAgeHours:
    Type: Number
    Default: 24
    Description: >-
      The minimum age of a drift detection result in hours to be marked for drift detection. The system will trigger a new
      drift detection after this time has passed from the previously completed drift detection. From 24 hours to
      168 hours (1 week).
    MinValue: 24
    MaxValue: 168
  ScanFrequencyHours:
    Type: Number
    Default: 1
    Description: >-
      The number of hours between scans. Each scan triggers as many drift detections in a region as DriftDetectionBatchSize.
      From 1 hour to 24 hours.
    MinValue: 1
    MaxValue: 24
  DriftDetectionBatchSize:
    Type: Number
    Default: 20
    Description: >-
      Maximum number of drift detections to be triggered per region by the system in every scan. Adjust this value in combination
      with ScanFrequencyHours based on the number of Stacks you have.
    MinValue: 1
    MaxValue: 200
  ExcludedStackArns:
    Type: String
    Default: ""
    Description: >-
      Comma-separated list of CloudFormation Stack ARNs to be excluded by the system. Each item can be a regular expression
      without the comma character or a full CloudFormation Stack ARN.
